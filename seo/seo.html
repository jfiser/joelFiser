            <p class=caption2>Photorealism: Paintings about Photography</p><p class=caption1><strong>It's no coincidence</strong> that the rise of Modern Art coincides with the popular acceptance of photography. Painters saw the need to distance themselves from what quickly became photography's domain - recording a moment in space and time.</p>

                <p class=caption2>Respecting the Flatness of the Canvas </p><p class=caption1><strong>Soon after the camera </strong>went mainstream, the method of fooling the eye came to be regarded as taking the easy way out, or inauthentic. Instead of making the 2D canvas look 3D, painters began to try to conform the 3D world to the flat canvas.</p>

                <p class=caption2>All-over painting </p><p class=caption1><strong>As painters moved away from mimicking </strong>the 3D World, they questioned the notion of even painting a subject. A subject pulls the eye toward itelf and demands attention to its area of the canvas. If it was removed, could every part of a painting be interesting?</p>
